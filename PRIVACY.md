# Privacy Policy for GraphQL Inspector

**Last updated: December 26, 2025**

## Overview

GraphQL Inspector ("the App") is a Safari extension designed to help developers debug GraphQL requests. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.**

GraphQL Inspector:
- Does NOT collect personal information
- Does NOT track your browsing activity
- Does NOT send any data to external servers
- Does NOT use analytics or tracking services
- Does NOT store any data outside your device

## How the App Works

The App operates entirely on your local device:

1. **Request Interception**: The extension intercepts GraphQL network requests only on web pages you visit while the extension is active.

2. **Local Storage**: All captured request data (queries, variables, responses) is stored temporarily in your browser's memory and is cleared when you close the browser tab or clear the extension data.

3. **No External Communication**: The App does not communicate with any external servers. All functionality is performed locally on your device.

## Data You Can Access

The App displays:
- GraphQL queries and mutations from websites you visit
- Request variables and parameters
- Server responses
- HTTP headers

This information is only visible to you and is never transmitted anywhere.

## Third-Party Services

GraphQL Inspector does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information and is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

**Summary**: GraphQL Inspector is a privacy-focused tool. We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your data. Everything stays on your device.
